// Assuming test-sqlite-service.js should be test-sqlite-service.ts
// And assuming other .ts files are correctly referenced with .ts extension.

// Example of how the imports would look in a .ts file if the original intention was to have them as .ts
// import { sqliteService } from './services/sqliteService.ts';
// import { storage } from './storage.ts';
// const { databaseConnector } = await import('./services/databaseConnector.ts');

// Since the original file is empty and the provided changes are contradictory,
// I cannot generate the specific code.
