APPLY — Phase 2 Micro-Batch 4 (Remove /client shim)
BUDGET POLICY: $1 MAX (aim $0). Micro-batch caps: ≤10 files OR ≤200 changed lines. ≤1 restart if absolutely unavoidable.

Files to edit (target ≤4 files total):
1) vite.config.ts
   - Replace any references to "client" paths with "apps/admin-ui".
   - Example minimal change:
     - from: resolve(__dirname, "client")
     -   to: resolve(__dirname, "apps/admin-ui")
     - from: resolve(__dirname, "client", "index.html")
     -   to: resolve(__dirname, "apps/admin-ui", "index.html")

2) server/vite.ts
   - Update any absolute/relative references to "client" → "apps/admin-ui".
   - Keep edits minimal; update error message text that mentions “client” → “admin-ui”.

3) tsconfig.json (root)
   - If it references client/*, update path(s) to apps/admin-ui/* (2–3 lines max).
   - Do NOT restructure compilerOptions; change only the specific path strings.

4) tailwind.config.ts (if present)
   - If “content” includes client/**/*, change to apps/admin-ui/**/* (1 line).

DELETE list (remove these ONLY after the edits above are saved):
- client/index.html
- client/src/main.tsx
- client/src/App.tsx
- client/src/index.css
- client/src/lib/queryClient.ts (if exists)
- client/src/pages/ (entire directory if it exists)
- If the folder becomes empty, remove /client entirely.

Hard rules:
- No package installs. No Docker. No bulk search/replace across the repo.
- Keep each file diff ≤80 added/changed lines. Total ≤200 lines.
- Try to avoid restarts. If an auto-restart triggers after saving server/vite.ts, count it as the single allowed restart for this batch, then STOP further restarts.

VERIFY (local, cheap):
- Run: tsc --noEmit
- Run: node -e "console.log('shim-removed plan applied')"
- Print: list of deleted files (full paths)

REPORT (then STOP):
- Files edited (paths) + per-file line delta
- Files deleted (full paths)
- Restarts performed: 0 (or 1 if auto-triggered)
- Results of tsc --noEmit
- Budget status: on track
