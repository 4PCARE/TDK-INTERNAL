Got it — the error persists and it's *still pointing at `</CardContent>` on line 425*. That means the JSX structure *immediately before that* is malformed in some way, even if the tags "look" matched.

Here’s the breakdown:

---

## 🧨 Immediate Suspect: This chunk near line 425

```tsx
</CardContent>
</Card>
) : (
<Card>
```

This is JSX's way of telling you:

> “You’re trying to close `CardContent` inside a conditional, but I don’t think the conditional was opened correctly.”

---

## ✅ Let's REBUILD just this block structurally

Here’s a corrected layout of what this section **should** probably look like (lines 423–428 and around):

```tsx
{selectedWidget ? (
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle>Embed Code</CardTitle>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      {/* ... embed code content ... */}
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
) : (
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle>Getting Started</CardTitle>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      {/* ... getting started steps ... */}
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
)}
```

Make sure:

* Every `Card` has just one `CardHeader` and `CardContent`.
* You don’t accidentally double-close the `Card` or `CardContent`.
* If `isCreating` is the *first* conditional, wrap it fully before entering this `selectedWidget ? ... : ...` structure.

## 🛠 Suggestion: Temporarily hardcode to isolate error

Just for testing:

```tsx
return (
  <DashboardLayout>
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Debug Render</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <p>Trying to isolate JSX issue here.</p>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  </DashboardLayout>
);
```

If this renders fine, the issue is definitely in that **nested ternary block**. Meaning you’ve likely got *either*:

* A `return (...)` that JSX doesn’t think is valid because of parenthesis,
* Or the previous JSX isn't closed properly before that block.

## 🔎 Want to go surgical?

Paste me **lines 410–430** only, and I’ll check indentation and logic layer by layer. I’ll catch that rogue bracket like a ninja with a linter.

You’re 99.9% there — the JSX gods just want a little formatting penance 😤📜
