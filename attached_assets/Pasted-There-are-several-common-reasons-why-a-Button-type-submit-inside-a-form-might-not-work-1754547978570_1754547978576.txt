There are several **common reasons** why a `<Button type="submit">` inside a `<form>` might not work — meaning, the `onSubmit` handler doesn’t trigger. Let's break it down for your code:

---

### ✅ You're using:

```tsx
<form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-6">
```

Which is correct, assuming:

* `form` is properly initialized via `useForm()` from something like `react-hook-form`.
* `onSubmit` is a valid function (not undefined or throwing).

---

### 🔍 **Now, potential culprits**:

---

#### 1. 🧠 **The `<Button type="submit">` is outside the `<form>`**

In your code:

```tsx
{/* Submit Button - Always visible */}
<div className="flex justify-end space-x-4 pt-6 border-t">
  <Link href="/agent-chatbots">
    <Button type="button" variant="outline">
      Cancel
    </Button>
  </Link>
  <Button
    type="submit"
    ...
  >
```

Check carefully — the submit button is rendered **after** the closing `</form>` tag:

```tsx
</form> // ← Here ends the form
{/* Submit Button - Always visible */}
<div className="flex justify-end ...">
```

🚨 **This means the submit button is outside the form.**
That’s the likely reason the form isn’t submitting when the button is clicked.

---

### ✅ Fix:

Move the submit button **inside** the `<form>` block, e.g.:

```tsx
<form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-6">
  ...
  {/* Submit Button - Always visible */}
  <div className="flex justify-end space-x-4 pt-6 border-t">
    <Link href="/agent-chatbots">
      <Button type="button" variant="outline">
        Cancel
      </Button>
    </Link>
    <Button
      type="submit"
      ...
    >
      ...
    </Button>
  </div>
</form>
```

### Optional: 🧪 Test Your Theory

To confirm that’s the issue:

* Add a `console.log("submitted!")` to your `onSubmit`
* Click the button.
* If nothing appears, it's definitely not wired correctly.

---

### Bonus sanity checks 🧠

If moving it inside still doesn't work:

* Check that no `preventDefault` is accidentally getting called.
* Ensure `form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)` is valid — no typos or undefined.

---

Let me know if you want me to review `onSubmit` and `useForm()` logic too! But TL;DR:

> 💣 **Your submit button is outside the form.**
>
> 💡 Move it inside, and it'll likely work as expected.
