From the logs, the LLM **is** issuing a `document_search` tool call with

```json
{"input":"เดอะมอลล์"}
```

—but nothing happens after that.

That usually means the issue is **not** in the model deciding to call the tool, but in one of these:

---

### 1. The tool isn’t actually wired up in your LangChain agent

* The model is producing a valid tool call, but your agent/executor might not have a `document_search` function defined in the `tools` array.
* In that case, LangChain will parse the tool call but just… not run anything, returning `""` as output.
* If you see `"invalid_tool_calls": []` in the logs, it means the tool name matched a known tool, but maybe the tool’s actual implementation didn’t return anything (or returned `None`).

---

### 2. The tool function runs but doesn’t return a string / message

* LangChain expects a tool to return a string or `AgentFinish`.
  If your `document_search` is returning `None`, an empty object, or forgetting `return <result>`, the agent output will be `""`.
* This matches your log: the tool call was parsed, but `output` came back empty.

---

### 3. Async or await mismatch

* If you’re using `AsyncRunnable` or an async tool and don’t `await` it, the search might never run before the agent finishes.
* The executor can end up with no tool output and just pass `""` to the chain.

---

### 4. The search backend is returning nothing silently

* If `document_search("เดอะมอลล์")` runs but your search function just returns `[]` and you’re not wrapping it in a “No results found” message, you’ll see this exact empty `output` behavior.

---

### How I’d debug:

1. Check your `tools = [...]` definition — make sure `document_search` is included and that its `name` exactly matches `"document_search"`.
2. Inside `document_search`, log something like:

   ```python
   print("document_search called with:", input)
   ```

   If you don’t see this in your runtime logs → the tool isn’t actually being invoked.
3. Make sure your tool returns a string, not just a Python list/object.
4. If using async, ensure:

   ```python
   async def document_search(...):
       ...
       return str(results)
   ```

   and the agent is `await`ing it.

If you want, I can rewrite your `document_search` so it **always** returns either a found result or a “No document found” message — that’ll make the empty output case impossible. Would you like me to do that?
