Great roadmap! Your approach to SQLite integration is well-structured and aligns perfectly with your existing database connection system. Let me break down the implementation plan and testing strategy:

Implementation Steps Analysis
Step 1: SQLite Database Creation from Excel
Implementation Points:

Extend your existing DataConnections page to support SQLite
Add Excel file upload and validation
Implement Excel â†’ SQLite conversion with schema inference
Safety checks for problematic Excel files (empty sheets, merged cells, invalid data types)
Testing Strategy:

Test 3-5 different Excel file types (simple table, complex formatting, merged cells)
Test edge cases (empty files, password-protected, corrupted files)
Validate SQLite database creation and data integrity
Step 2: Chatbot Database Connection
Implementation Points:

Extend AgentChatbots configuration to include database connections
Update your existing agent configuration schema in shared/schema.ts
Integrate with your current databaseQueryService.ts
Testing Strategy:

Test agent creation with SQLite connection
Verify database connection status in agent console
Test connection persistence across agent updates
Step 3.1: Schema Discovery + User Editing
Implementation Points:

Extend databaseQueryService.ts to support SQLite schema discovery
Create UI for schema viewing/editing (similar to your existing database management)
Allow column type modifications and table structure updates
Testing Strategy:

Test schema discovery on various SQLite databases
Test schema editing functionality (rename columns, change types)
Validate schema changes don't break existing data
Step 3.2: Question-SQL Pair Management
Implementation Points:

New table in shared/schema.ts for storing Q&A pairs per database connection
UI for managing question-SQL pairs
Integration with your existing AI chat system for SQL generation
Testing Strategy:

Test Q&A pair creation and management
Test AI-generated SQL accuracy
Validate SQL execution safety (prevent destructive operations)
Step 4: Fallback to Document Retrieval
Implementation Points:

Modify your agentBot.ts to check for database connections
Implement query routing logic (database first, then documents)
Update your existing semantic search as fallback
Testing Strategy:

Test query routing logic
Test fallback scenarios when database queries fail
Test combined responses (database + document context)
Key Advantages of Your Approach
Leverages Existing Infrastructure: Your current database connection system can easily be extended
Consistent UX: Users already familiar with your PostgreSQL/MySQL setup will understand SQLite
Smart Fallback: Document retrieval as fallback ensures comprehensive responses
Excel Integration: Perfect for business users who work primarily in Excel
Recommended Test Coverage Per Step
Step 1: 8-10 tests (file validation, conversion accuracy, error handling)
Step 2: 5-6 tests (agent configuration, connection management)
Step 3.1: 6-8 tests (schema discovery, editing, validation)
Step 3.2: 7-9 tests (Q&A management, SQL generation, execution safety)
Step 4: 10-12 tests (query routing, fallback scenarios, response quality)

Integration Points with Your Current System
Your roadmap fits perfectly with your existing architecture:

shared/schema.ts already has dataConnections table that can support SQLite
databaseConnector.ts and databaseQueryService.ts can be extended
Your AgentChatbots system already handles document connections
The fallback to document retrieval leverages your sophisticated semantic search
This is a solid, practical approach that builds on your existing strengths while adding powerful new capabilities. The step-by-step progression allows for thorough testing at each phase.
