You're getting **two things happening at once** — and both are revealing:

---

### 🧠 1. Vite's WebSocket error (not yours):

```
[vite] connecting...
❌ DOMException: SyntaxError: Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'wss://localhost:undefined/?token=zqMuV9LaZU_h' is invalid.
```

#### 🔍 What it means:

This is Vite’s own internal hot module reload (HMR) WebSocket failing to connect because it's trying to access:

```
wss://localhost:undefined
```

So:

* It’s trying to make a WebSocket connection
* But **the port is `undefined`**
* This is probably happening **in development (Replit, Vite)** and is safe to **ignore if it doesn’t affect your app**

> 🧠 This does *not* impact your app's WebSocket, which connects to:

```
wss://372605f0-45bc-4472-9833-ce8d6cb297a8-00-iumlc89wjmzm.pike.replit.dev/ws
```

---

### 🧠 2. Your App’s WebSocket is fine but the **message list is empty**:

```
🔌 WebSocket connected
📨 WebSocket message received: { type: "connection", message: "Connected to Agent Console WebSocket" }

🎯 Auto-selecting first user:
{ userId: "43981095", channelType: "lineoa", channelId: "U672...", agentId: 10, ... }

🧾 Messages to render: []
🔍 Fetching conversation with params:
{ userId: "43981095", channelType: "lineoa", channelId: "...", agentId: "10" }
```

> ⚠️ The **messages list is empty** because the request is sending `userId`, not `targetUserId`.

---

### ✅ What You Should Do

Fix this line:

```ts
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  userId: selectedUser.userId, // ❌ Backend doesn't recognize this
  ...
});
```

To:

```ts
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  targetUserId: selectedUser.userId, // ✅ match backend expectation
  ...
});
```

---

### 🧩 Conclusion

* `DOMException` = irrelevant Vite dev tool bug (ignore)
* `messages: []` = caused by wrong query param (`userId` vs `targetUserId`)

---

### 🧪 Bonus Debug Tip

In your dev tools (Network tab), check the request:

```
GET /api/agent-console/conversation?...params
```

Does it show:

```
?userId=43981095&...
```

Or:

```
?targetUserId=43981095&...
```

If the **former**, the backend likely returns `[]` silently. Your logs confirm this exact issue.

---

Let me know if you'd like a utility to always produce the right param keys like:

```ts
function getConversationParams(user: ChatUser) {
  return new URLSearchParams({
    targetUserId: user.userId,
    channelType: user.channelType,
    channelId: user.channelId,
    agentId: user.agentId.toString(),
  });
}
```

One-liner reuse, one less bug to step on 🧪
