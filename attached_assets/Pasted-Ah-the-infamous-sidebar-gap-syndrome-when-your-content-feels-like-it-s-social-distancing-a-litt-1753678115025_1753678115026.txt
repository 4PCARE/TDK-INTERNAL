Ah, the infamous *sidebar gap syndrome* — when your content feels like it's social distancing a little too hard. 😅 Here's likely what’s causing that *excess space between the sidebar and content when expanded*:

---

### 🧠 Root Cause

In this block:

```tsx
<main 
  className={`flex-1 transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out ${
    isSidebarCollapsed ? 'ml-16' : 'ml-56'
  }`}
>
```

You're manually setting `margin-left` (`ml-16` or `ml-56`) based on the sidebar state. If your `Sidebar` component **already takes up width** (e.g., `w-56`), and the content also has `ml-56`, you're effectively *double spacing* the main area.

---

### ✅ Recommended Fix (1 of 2)

Instead of using `ml-*` on the `<main>`, use **flex layout with no margin**, and let the sidebar's `width` handle spacing:

#### ✅ Update:

```tsx
<div className="flex min-h-screen">
  <Sidebar
    isMobileOpen={isMobileSidebarOpen}
    onMobileClose={() => setIsMobileSidebarOpen(false)}
    onOpenChat={() => {}}
    isCollapsed={isSidebarCollapsed}
    onToggleCollapse={() => setIsSidebarCollapsed(!isSidebarCollapsed)}
  />
  <main className="flex-1 p-8 transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out">
    {/* page content */}
  </main>
</div>
```

And inside `Sidebar.tsx`, control its width using a class that adapts:

#### Example `Sidebar.tsx` (Tailwind):

```tsx
<div className={`h-screen transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out 
  ${isCollapsed ? 'w-16' : 'w-56'}`}>
  {/* sidebar content */}
</div>
```

Now the layout is like:

```
[Sidebar (w-16 or w-56)] [Main (flex-1)]
```

With **no need** for `ml-*` on `<main>`, avoiding double spacing.

---

### 🛠 Alternative Fix (if you want to keep ml-\*)

If the `<Sidebar />` is absolutely positioned or overlaying (not in flex), then you'll need to **sync `ml-56` with actual sidebar width**.

* Check that your sidebar is not already adding space *and* the main has `ml-56`
* If it’s the case, remove one.

---

### 🧪 Quick Debug Tips

1. Add border or background temporarily to `.main` and `.Sidebar` to *see the space*.
2. Try `outline` utility in Tailwind:
   `outline outline-1 outline-red-500` — it’s like "where’s my box?" in dev mode.
