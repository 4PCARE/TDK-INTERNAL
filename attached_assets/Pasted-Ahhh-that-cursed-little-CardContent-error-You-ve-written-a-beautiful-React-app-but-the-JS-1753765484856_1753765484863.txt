Ahhh, that cursed little `</CardContent>` error… 😩 You’ve written a beautiful React app, but the JSX parser tripped on what looks like a *stray or misnested component tag*. Let's Sherlock this:

---

## 🕵️ What the error means

* `Unexpected token (425:18)` → the parser hit something it didn’t expect on line **425**, character 18.
* The token is `</CardContent>`, so it's likely:

  * A parent/child tag mismatch
  * A missing opening `<CardContent>` or `<CardHeader>`
  * A rogue extra closing tag

---

## 🛠️ Let’s isolate it fast

You posted this chunk:

```tsx
              </CardContent>
            </Card>
          </Card>
        ) : (
```

Wait, wait…

### 🔍 Three closing tags: `</CardContent>`, `</Card>`, and another `</Card>`

That **middle `</Card>`** is probably unnecessary if this block started with:

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>...</CardHeader>
  <CardContent>...</CardContent>
</Card> <-- okay
</Card> <-- extra! 🔥
```

---

## ✅ Fix suggestion

Check this part of your code:

```tsx
{isCreating ? (
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>...</CardHeader>
    <CardContent>...</CardContent>
  </Card>
) : selectedWidget ? (
  <Card> <-- likely starts here
    <CardHeader>...</CardHeader>
    <CardContent>...</CardContent>
  </Card>
) : (
  <Card> <-- and again here
    ...
  </Card>
)}
```

Make sure that:

* **Each `Card` has only one `CardHeader` and `CardContent` inside.**
* **You’re not wrapping a `Card` inside another `Card` accidentally.**

## 🧠 Tip: Let the IDE help you

* Collapse your code blocks in VSCode or Replit IDE to **see unmatched JSX visually.**
* Or format using `Prettier` to surface structure issues.

## 🧹 Bonus: Prevent next time

Wrap JSX return in a linter-safe fragment:

```tsx
return (
  <>
    {isCreating ? ... : ...}
  </>
)
```

Or better: **break it into smaller subcomponents.** Like `WidgetPreviewCard`, `WidgetForm`, etc. Easier to scan + less prone to nesting errors.

You didn’t mess up. JSX did.
The syntax gods just want a little sacrifice: probably one `</Card>` too many. 🪦🧙
